# Saving the RTF #
Right now I'm using a modified version of the create.php translated to CF from the [AlivePDF](http://code.google.com/p/alivepdf/) project. For Flex you **MUST** have something that can output the binary data generated by Flex to the user. The Save.CFM file does just that. You can find it in the downloads. For AIR projects, this is not required. Just save the byteArray returned by save() to the file system.

## The basics of creating the rtf ##
```
var document:RTF = new RTF();
document.writeText("Any text you want goes here");
document.save(Method.REMOTE,"save.cfm","inline","anything.rtf","_blank");
```
Thinking out loud: format will probably become optional in the future... if not provided, and group is, attempt to inherit from group. If it is supplied and group is supplied the inherit unset values.

## Formatting Text ##
Use the Format() object, pass it into writeText or addTextGroup.

## Applying a format to more than one writeText() ##
You can pass the same format object into both writeText calls OR you can create a text group.
```
var document:RTF = new RTF();
var format:Format = new Format();
format.underline=true;
document.addTextGroup("UnderlinedText",format);
document.writeText("Any text you want goes here",new Format(),"UnderlinedText");
document.writeText("This text isn't part of the group, so it doesn't get the underline", new Format());
```

## Use a format in more than one Area ##
Unlike some libraries where you constantly have to change the style as you go, RTFlex letes you pre-define formats and use them over and over. In the future, these will be saved as RTF stylesheets, but for now they present manually in the exported file.
```
var document:RTF = new RTF();
var header:Format = new Format();
var body:Format = new Format();
header.fontSize = 18;
header.bold=true;
header.color=new RGB(98,0,0);
header.font = FONTS.TIMES_NEW_ROMAN;
body.fontSize = 12;
body.font = FONTS.ARIAL;

document.writeText("This is a header \n",header);
document.writeText("This is the body of the document \n",body);
document.writeText("Another header \n",header);
document.writeText("More body text. \n",body);
```
