**Update** I ported this to Node.JS, you can view the project here: https://github.com/jrowny/node-rtf

**No longer maintained** This project is no longer maintained. If you'd like to become the new maintainer, go ahead and contact me and I'll set it up.

A lot of clients want easy printing, document generation, and formats compatible with most computers. Rich Text Format (RTF) is a widely used and understood format. It can be opened on Windows by Microsoft Word, WordPad. On MacOSX by TextEdit. One Linux/All by OpenOffice, AbiWord, and KWord.

This ActionScript 3 library tries to make generating RTF files as simple as absolutely possible. It is based on RTF1, which dates back 20 years! In the future, I'd love to add more features, but I'll need your help!
